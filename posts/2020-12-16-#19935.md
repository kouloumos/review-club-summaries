### PR#19935 - [Move SaltedHashers to separate file and add some new ones](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19935) [:eyes:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935)

## Questions

#### Why do we need to specify a “hasher” when defining a `std::unordered_map`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-36)

- Because the standard library has no implementations for user-defined classes, so `std::unordered_map` doesn't know how it should hash our (custom) bitcoin objects.
- Hashers are generally used to construct hash maps, which is a data structure that has fast item lookup, addition and removal. They allow lookup of elements in O(1) time in the typical/best-case scenario although implementation can affect this. For a more detailed description of the hash functions used in `std::unordered_map`, see [Hash functions for C++ Unordered Containers](https://marknelson.us/posts/2011/09/03/hash-functions-for-c-unordered-containers.html).


#### What exactly is a `Coin` as used by `CCoinsMap` and hashed using `SaltedOutpointHasher`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-44)

- A `Coin` is a UTXO. The canonical representation of that is `CTXOutPoint(txid, n)` which are the elements SipHash'ed by `SaltedOutpointHasher`.

- The concept of a `Coin` was introduced in [PR#10195](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195)

#### Why does `src/coins.cpp` use a `SaltedOutpointHasher` rather than a `SaltedTxidHasher`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-64)

- `SaltedTxidHasher` alone is not a canonical representation of a Coin/UTXO. The specific txOut must be referenced. If we used `SaltedTxidHasher` then all the UTXOs from the same transaction would hash to the same result which would be, sub-optimal.
- Using `SaltedTxidHasher` would require storing all of the outputs in a list in the value, vs. using the outpoint to point to one specific UTXO.

#### [extra question] Are there any potential downsides to using an Outpoint-based system? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-70) 
- Larger on disk representation, slower lookup due to one entry per output vs one per tx. Also affects the ability to test directly against the UTXO set (ths may not be an issue).
- Ιts primary downside was that it required reading all unspent outputs of a tx left from disk any time any of them were spent and this led to a DOS vulnerability.

- That vulnerability could be exploited by first create tx with lots of outputs, then create a tx that spends one UTXO from each. Now you may need gigabytes of memory to load all the UTXOs from all those.

#### What is a “salt” and why are they used in `SaltedTxidHasher`, `SaltedOutpointHasher` and `SaltedSipHasher`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-100)

-  ["What is salt?" answer](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/2010) on crypto.stackexchange
-  Salt is usually used in hashers to make the output of the hash function unpredictable to parties that know the input but not the salt. So an attacker can not know how the buckets are being constructed. otherwise you can create O(n) behaviour.
- `std::unordered_set` puts objects into buckets based on their hash value. An adversary who can create hash collisions at will can force a large number of items into the same bucket meaning that lookup time goes from 0(1) to 0(n)
- Two `uint64_t (m_k0, m_k1)` [used as salts in](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr19935/src/util/hasher.cpp#L14) `SaltedSipHasher` instead of just one because siphash happens to use a 128-bit key.
	- SipHash is the gold standard for hash table bucket hashing to protect against collisions, it's a PRF that takes as input a key (="salt") and a message.

#### Why are salts not used in `BlockHasher` and `FilterHeaderHasher`? If the aim of the salt is to prevent collisions, then why do we not need to worry about that for blocks? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-126)

- Because the work to create a valid block hash is many magnitudes higher than creating an unconfimed tx. 
- If someone wanted to create a collision in our `BlockMap`, they'd need to be mining valid blocks which **also** collide in the BlockHasher function.

#### What is a boost multi-index? How is the `SaltedTxidHasher` used in the mempool multi-index? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-146)

- A `multi_index` maintains multiple indices on the same data set. [`indexed_transaction_set`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6a480636/src/txmempool.h#L517-L547) is a multi_index on the mempool. `SaltedTxidHasher` is used to maintain the mempool sorted by txid and wtxid for fast lookups by txid and wtxid respectively.

#### This PR introduces a new `SaltedSipHasher` that takes a `Span` as input, what are the advantages to this? Are there any places where we wouldn't be able to use such a "generic" hasher? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19935#l-154)

- This new implementation allows arbitrary strings to be SipHash'd. This would allow a single hasher to be used with any of `uint256`, `CPubKey`, `CScript`, `CKeyId`, and generics like `std::vector<unsigned char>`.
- It's not easy to use the `SaltedSipHasher` with `Span` in places where the keyed hash is saved to disk ([example](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3f205808a5f20c9398d8e74b7e83220a129acc7d/src/addrman.cpp#L14)) . If the hash function is changed, then the object would no longer hash to the same digest.
- Core has a custom re-implementation of `Span` ([src/span.h](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr19935/src/span.h)) that implements a subset of the C++20 span.
