### PR#25720 - [Reduce bandwidth during initial headers sync when a block is found](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25720) [:eyes:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720)

A PR by Suhas Daftuar to reduce bandwidth during initial headers sync when a block is found, **by changing the logic** of initiating additional headers sync with all announcing peers of a new block, **to just one sync for each new block announcement**. Participants discussed the origins of the current logic, how we are protected against peers stalling headers sync, what changes and the benefits of the new logic.

> :information_source: This was made somewhat more bandwidth-wasteful after [PR#25717](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717).

## Questions

#### Why do nodes (mostly) receive `inv` block announcements while they are doing initial headers sync, even though they indicated preference for `headers` announcements (BIP 130)? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720#l-30)

- A node only announces with a `headers` message if it is sure that the peer has already seen the parent block. Meaning the peer has previously sent a header to which the new header connects to (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a6fc293c0a1f27ba1e573bfa16fd76d5f58988b2/src/net_processing.cpp#L4975-L4978)).
- This node is in IBD so it doesn't know (= has not downloaded) the parent block of the new block, therefore will not get a `headers` announcement.

#### Why is bandwidth wasted (during initial headers sync) by adding all peers that announce a block to us via an `inv` as headers sync peers? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720#l-62)

- We get a lot of announcements which translates to header syncing with a lot of peers resulting to **receiving duplicate headers across multiple peers**.
- This duplicate headers during IBD (across multiple peers) was attempted to be fixed back in 2016 with [PR#8054](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8054), [but the fix had to be reverted](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8306).
- A related issue with multiple `getheaders` message to the same peer was fixed with [PR#25454](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25454)

#### What would be your estimate (lower/upper bound) of how much bandwidth is wasted? (There is no one true answer here, the estimate depends on a couple of variables) [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720#l-79)

- The amount of bandwidth wasted (duplicate data) depends on the progress made (in the initial sync) until the block announcement is received. 
- The estimate is something like `size_of_header * remaining_number_of_blocks * (number_of_peers - 1)`. The estimate could be improved by accounting for the `getheaders` messages but they are probably small in comparison.


#### What’s the purpose of `CNodeState`’s members `fSyncStarted` and `m_headers_sync_timeout`, and `PeerManagerImpl::nSyncStarted`? If we start syncing headers with peers that announce a block to us via an `inv`, why do we not increase `nSyncStarted` and set `fSyncStarted = true` and update `m_headers_sync_timeout`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720#l-102)

- `fSyncStarted` tells us whether we've started headers synchronization with this peer.
- `nSyncStarted` corresponds to the number of peers with `fSyncStarted = true`.
- `m_headers_sync_timeout` is only used for our initially chosen headers-sync peer (if `nSyncStarted == 1`) and it tells us when to potentially disconnect peer for stalling headers download. [Its value depends on how much time we have between tip and today](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92f6461cfd39fff2fc885dd623fa47e7d8d53827/src/net_processing.cpp#L4904-L4910).
- (src: sipa) "Historically, I think the case is just that it was never intended that we'd be syncing headers from non-`nSyncStarted` peers. But it turned outs that (a) we actually do and (b) this is actually somewhat advantageous because it prevents a situation that the singular chosen `nSyncStarted` peer is malicious/broken/infinitely slow, and stalls your headers sync forever. (I can say this as the person who first introduced the headers syncing and `nSyncStarted` concept, until not too recently I wasn't actually aware that we'd start fetching headers from other peers as well if they'd announce a new block to us)."

#### An alternative to the approach taken in the PR would be to add an additional headers sync peer after a timeout (fixed or random). What is the benefit of the approach taken in the PR over this alternative? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25720#l-135)

- Peers that announce an `inv` to us have a higher probability of being responsive. The peer that manages to send us the block `inv` first is often also a very fast peer. So we'd not pick another slow peer if for some reason our initial peer is slow.


## Extra knowledge from the discussion

- Headers are actually 81 bytes on the wire, not 80. The notion of a block header as a protocol concept didn't exist originally. Headers were just blocks without transactions. That's why they are serialized as empty `CBlock`s, therefore having 1 extra byte for the empty transaction vector.
