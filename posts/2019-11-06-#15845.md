### PR#15845 - [Fast rescan with BIP157 block filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15845) [:eyes:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845)

A PR by Marco Falke to use BIP157 block filters (if available) in order to speed up rescans by fetching only the blocks matched by the computed Golomb-Coded Set of all the wallet’s scripts.

# Notes

- This PR was eventually Closed. 
- Other takes on faster wallet rescan:
    - [PR#19116](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19116) (Closed)
    - [PR#25957](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25957) (Open)
    - [Issue#23727](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23727) aggregates ideas for making wallet rescans substantially faster.

## Questions

#### How many scripts will a newly created wallet have? How many items will be added to the GCS returned by `GetAllRelevantScriptPubKeys()`? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845#l-39)

- The keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the addresses of those keys. 
- There are 2 keypools (external and change) and each has 1000 keys. Each key has 3 scriptPubKeys (p2pkh, p2sh-p2wpkh, native p2wpkh).
- Therefore with an empty, newly created wallet we are initially looking out for 6000 different scripts.

#### In the current (pre-PR) code, what happens when we find a matching scriptPubKey for a key that is in our keypool in a block transaction? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845#l-97)

- [`ScanForWalletTransactions`][CWallet::ScanForWalletTransactions] is where this happens and specifically at [`SyncTransaction`][ScanForWalletTransactions.SyncTransaction].
- We add the UTXO to the wallet db `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`, [mark the keypool keys as used][AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe.MarkUnusedAddresses] (and every keypool entry before it) and before continuing, [top up the keypool][MarkUnusedAddresses.TopUp] back to the 'gap limit' (as long as the wallet is unlocked (not encrypted)).
- The gap limit of 1000 means that if there are any gaps, or the keys are used out-of-order, then as long as the gap is less than 1000, we won't miss any transactions.
    - A gap in your external addresses can occur when you give out an address and someone just not pay you. 
    - A gap in change addresses is less likely. If you RBF bump, then you use a new key for change (#TOVALIDATE).
    - Addresses can be seen out-of-order if you create txns at different fee rates that get mined at different times.
    - This limit started with 100 and after HD-wallets [bumped to 1000][PR#10831].
-  **We DO NOT** update our balance, that is done dynamically whenever it's needed.

#### bonus: Has anyone spotted the bug in this PR yet? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845#l-164)

- It's important to TopUp the keypool in the rescan loop to make sure that if keys are used in order then we won't miss any transactions.
- We are building the Golomb-Coded Set (GCS) filter from the response of `GetAllRelevantScriptPubKeys()` at the beginning, outside the rescan loop. That means as we advance through the blockchain, it doesn't get updated.
- What happens if you create a wallet, make a backup, then receive 1001 payments, and then try to restore from that backup?
- Only the initial 1000 keys are in the backup, which means that the GCS filter will not include the topup keys.
- From [this comment][comment] is seems that an earlier version of the PR might have recalculated the GCS for each block, which fixes this bug but is slow.

#### What is the false positive rate for Basic compact block filters? [:link:](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845#l-199)

- It's supposed to be `1/M`. M [is specified in BIP158][M-bip] and can also be spotted as [a parameter in the codebase][M-codebase].
- So, a transaction that isn't in a block will return positive with probability `1/784931`.
- That means that a full keypool of addresses will return positive with a probability of `(1 - (784930/784931)^6000) ≈ 6000/784931`
- Sipa has [a write up on the optimization][sipa-optimization].
